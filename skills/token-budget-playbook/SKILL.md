description: How to keep an agent session's token cost low — which tools are compact-native, which to delegate to a subagent instead of calling from the main thread, and how the repo's own metrics/regression gate measures cost. Use before calling a verbose tool, or when a session feels like it is burning context too fast.

# token budget playbook

mcp-vertex treats token cost as a first-class invariant, not an
afterthought: the `metrics` tool measures it per-call
(`packages/core/src/lib/metrics/metrics-tool.ts`), and `f00027`'s CI gate
(`tools/scripts/metrics/diff-snapshots.script.ts`) fails the build if any
tool's bytes-per-call regresses more than the configured threshold
(default +20%) between releases. This skill is the day-to-day discipline
that keeps that gate green.

## Compact-first, then drill

Most plugin tools that can be "small or big" expose a `compact: true`
input — read it that way first, and only call the verbose form when you
actually need the extra detail:

| Verbose                  | Compact equivalent                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `proposal_board`          | `proposals_auto_work { compact: true }` / `proposals_compact_status` |
| `state_health` (full)     | `proposals_compact_status` for routine orientation; reserve `state_health` for suspected drift |
| `mcp-vertex_overview` (default) | `mcp-vertex_overview { compact: true }` |
| `audit_consolidate` with no scope | `audit_consolidate { scope: <narrow> }` |

## Tools to delegate, not call from the main thread

Per `CLAUDE.md`'s "keep the main thread cheap" rule: any of the following,
called from the orchestrating/root context, should instead be delegated to
a subagent (e.g. `mcp-vertex-orchestrator`) so the verbose result is
absorbed there and only a compact summary comes back:

- `proposal_board` in its verbose form.
- `state_health` full dumps (vs the compact `healthy: boolean` check).
- `audit_consolidate` without a `scope` filter.
- `search` with `maxResults > 50`.

## How the regression gate measures cost

The persisted `metrics` snapshot
(`<cacheDir>/metrics/<ISO>.json`, written by `metrics { persist: true }`)
records `totalBytes` and `totalMs` *cumulative across the whole process
run* per tool. The CI gate normalises that to **bytes-per-call** and
**ms-per-call** before diffing against the previous release's snapshot —
raw totals would conflate "called more often" with "got more expensive
per call". If you add a new tool or change an existing tool's output
shape, expect the next `metrics-gate` CI run to pick up the delta; a
genuine increase in payload size should be a deliberate trade-off, not an
accident from e.g. forgetting a `compact` branch.

## `/compact` between unrelated tasks

Once a slice or proposal is closed and you are about to start unrelated
work, run `/compact` (or your host's equivalent) before continuing — do
not carry a closed slice's verbose tool output forward for the rest of the
session. The cost of re-reading a digest you already have is strictly
worse than the cost of letting it drop and re-fetching only if actually
needed later.

## Smoke

The in-process token-budget e2e
(`packages/core/tests/src/lib/e2e/token-budget.e2e.spec.ts`) fails the
build if `mcp-vertex_overview`'s compact payload exceeds its measured
budget — if you see that test fail after a change to `overview-tool.ts`,
that is the signal this skill exists to prevent: a tool you thought was
"compact" silently grew.
